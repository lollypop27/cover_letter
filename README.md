Dear Employer,
Thank you for taking the time to read this letter.

I am a graphic designer who has had a dream of being a developer for a long time, I got the opportunity to complete an intensive 3-month coding bootcamp through Craft Academy Sweden via their online real-time immersive teaching program. 

The skill set and knowledge that I have gained from this 3 month course is using Agile Methods and TDD, coding in HTML, HAML, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, JQuery, testing with Jasmine, RSpec and Cucumber, scaffolding and building web apps for Rails with Postgres, as well as mobile apps using the Ionic and IDE tools such as Atom, RubyMine and DreamWeaver.

I am a good team player, problem solver and my passion, dedication and eagerness is to keep working with and learning from fellow developers to keep improving.

I am really grateful for you taking the time to read this letter and would love to hear from you. I have enclosed my resume and look forward to meeting. You can my review my Github account at https://github.com/lollypop27.

Sincerely,
Lara Templemore-Walters
