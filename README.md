Dear Employer,

Thank you for taking the time to read this letter.

I am a graphic designer who has had a dream of being a developer for a long time, I got the opportunity to complete an intensive 3-month coding bootcamp through Craft Academy Sweden via their online real-time immersive teaching program. 

The skill set and knowledge that I have gained from this 3 month course is using Agile Methods and TDD, coding in HTML, HAML, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, Jquery, testing with Jasmine, RSpec and Cucumber, scaffolding and building web apps for Rails with Postgres, as well as mobile apps using the Ionic and IDE tools such as Atom, RubyMine and DreamWeaver. I am very comfortable using Github, setting up branches and using git pong methods. We used Scrum tactics every day to keep up to date and further down the line we got the opportunity to be scrum master and manage coding tasks and the team.

Bootcamp has been an amazing challenge for me, where I learnt that I can push through the toughest of coding tasks with my team members and come out a better developer at the end of the given coding task.

Why choose me? I am a hard and dedicated coder and worker as well as a good team player, motivator, problem solver and my passion, dedication and eagerness is to keep working with and learning code from fellow developers to keep improving myself so that I too can call myself a senior developer in the near future.

In life, it is never too late or too old to find your working passion and am very fortunate to have found mine through the Craft Academy bootcamp.

I am really grateful for you taking the time to read this letter and would love to hear from you. I have enclosed my resume and look forward to meeting. You can my review my Github account at https://github.com/lollypop27.

Sincerely,

Lara Templemore-Walters
