Dear Employer,

Thank you for taking the time to read this letter.

I am a designer who has had a dream of being a developer for a long time. I completed an intensive 3-month coding bootcamp through Craft Academy Sweden via their online real-time immersive teaching program in 2016, where I discovered the wonderful methodology of Agile and Scrum.

Since this journey started, I have been keeping up with my newly discovered skill set, by joining the AgileVentures.org (AV) crowdsourced Agile development learning community, where I participate as a Junior Scrum Master and Junior RoR developer. AV also has weekly mobbing sessions where we learn a new language ( I am currently learning Elixir) and also improve on our current coding RoR and TDD/BDD skills.

I will be doing my Scrum Master Course and Certification during September 2017, as I have really found a passion for this role in my life by supporting and coaching fellow developers. 

At Craft Academy the skill set and knowledge that I have gained from those 3 month course includes Agile Methods and TDD, coding in Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, JQuery, HTML & HAML, and testing with Jasmine, RSpec and Cucumber.  I also scaffolded and built web apps for Rails with Postgres, as well as mobile apps using the Ionic framework and IDE tools such as Atom, RubyMine and DreamWeaver. I am very comfortable using Github, setting up branches and using git pong methods. We used Scrum tactics every day to keep up to date and we also had the opportunity to be scrum master and manage coding tasks and the team dynamics.

The bootcamp has been an amazing challenge for me, where I learnt that I can push through the toughest of coding tasks with my team members and come out a better developer at the end of the given coding task.

Why choose me? I am a hard and dedicated person as well as a good team player, motivator, problem solver and my passion, dedication and eagerness is to keep working with Senoir Scrum Masters and Developers to keep improving myself so that I too can call myself a Senior Scrum Master in the not too distant future.

In life, it is never too late or too old to find your working passion and I am very fortunate to have found mine through the Craft Academy bootcamp.

I am really grateful for you taking the time to read this letter and would love to hear from you. I have enclosed my resume and look forward to meeting you.
